# EV Sales India - Exploratory Data Analysis (2014 - 2024)

**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of electric vehicle (EV) sales in India from **2014 to 2024**. The analysis explores trends across **years, states, vehicle categories, and months**, and produces actionable visualizations to help policymakers, manufacturers, and data practitioners understand EV adoption patterns.

Through visual exploration and aggregation, this analysis reveals how India’s EV market has evolved, identifying key growth regions, popular vehicle classes, and the effect of time on adoption rates.

The insights from this project highlight the rapid rise in EV adoption after 2020, driven by government incentives, awareness, and improved technology.

This repository demonstrates the entire EDA pipeline from data cleaning and preprocessing to aggregation, visualization, and interpretation providing a clear view of India’s transition towards sustainable mobility.

The visualizations produced help in:

Understanding yearly and state-wise EV growth patterns.

Comparing vehicle category and type performance (2W, 3W, 4W, Bus, etc.).

Identifying top-performing states leading India’s EV revolution.

Observing seasonal and monthly trends in EV sales activity.

This project also emphasizes how data-driven insights can guide better decision-making for:

Policymakers to plan EV infrastructure and incentives.

Manufacturers to target emerging markets and production hubs.

Data professionals to explore sustainable technology adoption using analytics.
